                Meet Maieuran (he/him), a dance luminary hailing from London and Paris, whose artistic journey has been sculpted by the mentorship of Ryan from Trinity Warriors, Andrea Queens from AQ Arts, and the dynamic platform provided by BreakingGB. With proficiency in breaking, popping, hip hop, and Odissi, he has forged a unique identity known as Lyndy Breaks. Presently, under the tutelage of Gairika Mathur, a revered Odissi instructor in the UK, he is exploring the fusion of classical Indian dance with breaking, pioneering a genre he terms "classical breaks." Notable accolades include serving as the avant-garde artist for a groundbreaking PhD study on movement agency, collaborations with hip hop icon Tim Westwood, and fostering connections within a vibrant diaspora community, showcasing the universal language of dance.
